- [x] Reduced greed of version regexp in `setup.py`
    - TODO: Link to regexp performance

- [x] Fixed Linux casing in README
- [ ] Added installation instructions for `optional-dependencies`
- [x] Formalized `.travis.yml` steps into `requirements-dev.txt` and `./test.sh`
- [x] Added "Development" instructions in README (mostly for testing)

Not in this PR:

- Add `release.sh`
- Instead of emulating a `dict` for Config via `__getitem__`, `__setitem__`, etc. Why not inherit from a dict?
- Remove generic except from `load_config_file`
    - We should deliver an error message to the user
